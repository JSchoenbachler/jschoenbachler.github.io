            The light squeak of a marker across a whiteboard is a welcome change to the harsh screeches of chalk against a blackboard that seem to be present in most of the classrooms in the psychology department. This late in the semester, there is bound to be tons of writing done by the professor, which means a classroom with a blackboard can be quite excruciating to someone who hates the sound. Turner gives a slight yawn, and looks at the title of the course written on the board: “Psychology of Memory Perception”. This course sounds familiar but he doesn’t quite remember signing up for it. The irony is not lost on him.
    Turner looks outside and sees the last of winter melting away to reveal the life of spring beneath. It’s definitely a bit late into the spring semester. Turner turns to a class member and asks, “Can you remind me what we covered in class last week?”
    The student looks at him nervously, and shuffles his notes around muttering to himself before starting, “Well, last week we reviewed for today’s exam, mostly focusing on…” Well, shit. Turner tunes out the student’s anxious ramblings and is filled with anxiety of his own. An exam for a class he doesn’t remember signing up for, much less any of the material. He thinks that he must be having a mental break of some sort, which is surely a decent enough reason to get a delay for taking an exam.
    Turner suddenly realizes the other student has stopped talking and is staring at him, anxiously waiting for a response or acknowledgement of some kind. Turner, feeling uncomfortable, doesn’t quite know what to say and says a simple “Thanks.” He decides to shuffle through papers of his own and is confused by the mix of english and nonsensical symbols in his notes until it clicks for him what exactly is going on.

    Turner wakes up in the dark, short of breath, sweat clinging to the sheets. He slows his breathing and calms himself down, thinking how ridiculous it is to still be dreaming about college over a decade after graduating. He wonders if it says something about himself, to still have these dreams feeling out of place. He would tell a patient they might be experiencing “impostor syndrome”, have some sort of bad experience from college they need to work through, or simply that sometimes a dream is simply a dream, nothing more. However, he has a strict rule of not psychologically evaluating himself. It comes from the belief that introspection should either come naturally from within or be sparked from another professional. It’s too easy to overlook the bigger picture when methodically analyzing personal issues. Besides, as the saying goes “All the best therapists have therapists.”
    Breaking out of internal thoughts, Turner realizes he doesn’t hear the rhythmic clink of his ceiling fan above him, despite seeing the fan rotate. It then dawns on him that this isn’t his bed, and he doesn’t recognize the room he is in. He pinches himself and gives a light pat on the face to make sure he is lucid, and begins to take in his surroundings.
    It looks like he is in a hotel room of some sort. The room is largely unperturbed, with the only thing not looking sterile and perfectly tidy being the bed he is in. There is a lamp on each of the two bedside tables, and under one of them is a digital alarm clock that reads “02:14”. Light briefly illuminates the room as he hears a car drive by and he briefly gets a better look at his surroundings. He turns on a lamp to see more than what is in his immediate vicinity.
    By all accounts, it looks like he is in a perfectly normal hotel room. There is the bed he is on, the bedside tables, a basic writing desk, a reading chair, and a small “kitchen” area. The only thing of note is that a whiteboard with markers is on the wall opposite the bed, in place of a TV. He gets up and begins to walk around. The “kitchen” is a little underwhelming, only containing a sink, microwave, minifridge, and coffee maker.
    Turner’s anxiety has slowly been bubbling up inside, and he has maintained a steady hold on himself thus far, but that could change at any moment. He begins tensing up and tries to maintain focus. How did he get here? This place is simultaneously unfamiliar and familiar in a way that just seems to make things worse. He goes to look out the window and sees a basic 2 lane highway a couple of stories below. Shutting the curtain, he walks to the door, where an envelope is sitting on the ground. He opens it up to find a basic schedule:
    08:00 - Breakfast
    12:00 - Lunch
    14:00 - Clothes Drop-off
    18:00 - Dinner
    20:00 - Check-In Call
    He looks at the alarm clock to see it’s now 07:20. Has he really been awake for five hours? He decides to try the door handle, and it’s locked. Wait, that can’t be right. A hotel room, locked from the outside? Turner frantically tries to open the door again, and again, and again, not getting any closer to opening the door but getting much closer to having his anxiety fully boil over into panic. He stops to take some deep breaths and gets a glass of water. He takes a drink and turns around, feeling a final moment of control over his emotions before he panics into turmoil.
    The alarm clock now reads “08:01” and on the writing desk, there is now a plate with breakfast on it. That wasn’t there moments ago when he last saw the desk. In addition, his bed is now made. Nothing else has changed about the room, and certainly nobody has entered the room. Turner is frozen in place until he hears the sound of his glass shattering at his feet. He begins hyperventilating and his heart rate is going through the roof at this point. The flood of questions he was trying to keep at bay unleash in a tsunami of fear and panic. He starts looking around frantically and feels darkness closing in, the world crashing down around him as he crashes to the floor himself.

    Turner slowly comes to and realizes he is laying in bed. The same bed, in the same room he was in before. He takes a few deep breaths and looks around to see the clock reading “14:32”. The desk now has two plates of food, one holding breakfast and the other holding lunch. Additionally, some fresh laundry is folded at the foot of the bed. Turner manages to stamp down most of his anxiety and realizes he needs to eat something now and can try figuring out his situation later. He goes to the kitchen to grab a glass of water, realizing there is no glass or water on the floor. Did he imagine everything before? Before going to eat at the desk, he tries the door handle again only to find it’s still locked.
    Turner thinks that the food is pretty good for hotel food, but otherwise not too special. He finishes up and feels a little lightheaded. He is starting to panic again, not sure how to deal with the situation he is in. He looks outside again and decides to check the window. There is nowhere for it to open and no latch of any kind. Outside the window is the same highway, but there are no cars on it. Between the hotel and the highway there is a small field and on the other side of the highway is a treeline. Aside from that, he can’t see anything else outside.
    The phone rings on the bedside table and he breaks out of a trance, staring at the deep violet sunset sky. How long has he been staring out the window? The sickening anxiety begins to take over again as he walks towards the phone, trying to summon up the courage to answer. He reaches the table, but hasn’t quite reached the amount of courage he needs just yet. Turner takes a deep breath, and collects his mind. He wants to remain calm, who knows who could be on the other line. He picks up the phone.
    “Hello, Turner. How are you feeling today?” asks a voice on the other side of the line. The voice sounds familiar but he can’t put his finger on who it is or where he has heard the voice before.
    “Who are you, and where am I?” Turner asks, realizing he has made a mistake right off the bat. He should only ask one question at a time, and should have answered first. “I am feeling a bit disoriented, but otherwise fine,” he quickly adds, hoping to correct part of his mistake.
    The other end of the line is silent. “Hello?” Turner asks into the phone, which is greeted with more silence. After a few moments of further silence from both ends, Turner hears the line click and he hangs up as well. His stomach grumbles, and he just now realizes dinner is on the writing desk. He sits down to eat, and after some more time of nothing, lays down in bed to collect his thoughts before drifting off to sleep.

    Over a lunch of vegetable soup, Turner reflects on his time in the room over the past 2 weeks. He now had more questions than when he first woke up in the room. Every day has adhered to the schedule he found on the first day, without fail. The check-in was the most unsettling event of each day, that same voice asking “Hello, Turner. How are you feeling today?” Also unsettling was the fact that each morning when he woke up, the room would have been cleaned and tidied up. The plates and food from the meals would have disappeared, any mess made would no longer be there in the morning. It's as if the room had reset while he was asleep. After day 2 he decided he needed to do something to figure out what was happening.
    Day 3 he waited until 11:58 and stared at the desk while counting. Once he had counted over 5 minutes, he turned around, saw the clock switch from 11:59 to 12:00 and when he turned back food was on the desk. That night he left out a glass on the counter, which was put back in the cabinet by the time he woke up in the morning. Day 5 he decided to keep a journal and keep track of the days using the paper on the writing desk. He left his journal pages out that night to find them placed in a pile separate from the blank paper the following morning. Day 9 he tried smashing the window with the chair to find both the window and the chair unbreakable. Day 10 he wrote “FUCK THIS PLACE” on the whiteboard, and that remained overnight for whatever reason. Last night (the 14th night) he decided to make a mess and stand in the corner watching the room without going to sleep. He thought for sure he would catch someone coming in or see something happen. The last time he remembered being awake was 09:14, breakfast wasn’t on the table and the mess was still there. He woke up around 13:10 hunched in the corner of the room to see both breakfast and lunch on the desk, the room clean and tidy, the bed made, and “FUCK THIS PLACE” still written on the whiteboard.
    In between his “experiments”, journaling, and eating, he spent most of his time looking out the window. He hadn’t seen any cars, people, creatures, or anything else different outside. He would occasionally hear the sound of a car driving by, only to look outside and not see anything. At night the sounds would be accompanied by headlights lighting up the room, but when he went to the window nothing could be found.
    Turner felt completely lost. He had no idea why he was there, and besides, had no idea who was keeping him there. He hadn’t seen anyone or anything other than this room, he had no idea at all what was happening outside. For that matter, he couldn’t remember the last thing he did before he woke up in the room. He remembered big life events that had happened, but couldn’t for the life of him remember anything smaller than that. What month was it supposed to be again? What year? His memories were starting to blur, and he was getting nowhere but closer to another anxiety attack with this train of thought. He took one last bite of his sandwich and decided to try and relax before the check-in.

    “...Tabitha Smith, Benjamin Snodgrass, Turner Sorkin, Julia Song…” the Chancellor droned on as Turner walked up to accept his diploma. It wasn’t the real diploma, of course, that would be mailed to him once everything was approved by all of his professors and department heads, but walking for graduation was always symbolic. He was happy to finally be out of school and already had a job lined up. He was going to finally be able to help people. He wasn’t happy about paying the crazy amount of loans back, but at least now he wouldn’t have to take any more out.
    As he took the steps down off the stage, back to his seat he walked past Ellie, who gave him a smile and a gentle squeeze of the hand as she passed by him. Things were going to change, and he thought this was going to be when his life truly began.

    Turner woke up on day 30 not feeling much different than before. Two nights now he had gotten worked up and trashed the hotel room only to find it clean and tidy in the morning. As he started eating breakfast, he came to a decision. He needed to figure out why he was there. He got up from eating and began pacing around the room. Eventually he stopped in front of the whiteboard, and erased the angry ramblings he had written on it previously.
    With a marker in his hand, he took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and opened them ready to get started, but froze. Where previously there was nothing, right where he was about to write were the words “Why am I here?” underlined, in his handwriting. He jumped back and collected himself; it was definitely his handwriting. Had he spaced out? Regardless, it gave him a weird feeling. He approached the whiteboard again, took another deep breath, closed his eyes, and opened them ready to get started, but froze again. The writing was gone. He blinked a few times and collected himself. He had seen (or not seen) weirder things in his time here, so he simply took a deep breath and wrote “Why am I here?” again, then got started.

    By day 43 Turner had written and erased countless theories on the whiteboard. His current list was the following:
    1. KIDNAPPED BY A PSYCHO
    2. MENTAL BREAK
    3. GOVERNMENT EXPERIMENTATION
    4. PLACED IN SOME SORT OF SIMULATION
    5. ALIENS (ONLY KIND OF JOKING)
    6. LIMBO OR HELL
    He was hungry and tired of thinking about it, so he decided to take a break and eat lunch. As he took a final look at his list, he blinked and suddenly realized there was a new word on the whiteboard, below the other items in his list: “LAUGHTER”. It was written in his handwriting, in the space immediately below the 6th item. How did this appear? Did he space out again? Was it really his handwriting, or just a really good imitation? Questions raced through his mind, trying to make sense of everything. He had to keep it together. He took deep breaths, wiped his tears with a trembling hand and wrote  “7.” in front of “LAUGHTER”.

    “...so long as you both shall live?”
    “I do.” Turner stated. His eyes began to well lightly with tears as he looked into Ellie’s already tearful eyes. He never thought he would be so happy, let alone so happy to be in a municipal courthouse. He always kinda wanted to have a wedding ceremony and reception, but Ellie had convinced him (not that it took much convincing). His family might be a little sad to not have that, but they could all celebrate together sometime later. Right now this was just about him and Ellie.
    “By the power…” they were going to be so happy, he just knew it. “...from the state…” his life felt too good to be true. Marrying the love of his life, a career where he felt like he was really making a difference. “...and wife. You may now kiss!” Ellie and Turner embraced and kissed, perhaps for just a moment too long, given the setting. They released each other and turned to the counter, where the wedding certificate was. Grabbing a pen, it was time to sign their names. A new beginning for a new stage of life, Turner couldn’t be more excited.

    50 days. That was how long Turner had been trapped here. Over a month and a half, and he still felt no closer to figuring out what was going on. The past week had been spent agonizing over what “LAUGHTER” meant. Did it mean that he was supposed to laugh, and find this situation funny? He did laugh while he trashed the room in a state of mental anguish, and nothing different happened. Did it mean that someone kidnapped him and it was a sort of cruel joke? He often thought so long and hard on the word that it began to stop sounding like a word.
    He even felt strange about the word. It was written pretty much in line and in the next space he would have written an option, but it still seemed kind of out of place. Almost all of the theories he had written above could have something to do with laughter. The more he thought about it and analyzed it, the more he felt like laughing. And crying.
    He took a step away from the whiteboard and decided to write in his journal again. Since the days were sparse, only so much could be written down, so he had taken to trying to write down a timeline of his life and everything he remembered. He had the basics down; years, months, and (sometimes) dates of important life events. He shuffled through the spread papers on the desk, and couldn’t find them. Impossible, they were always there! The papers never disappeared before, why now? He was looking for about a half hour until he decided to get up, pace around, and breathe to calm down. He collected himself, took a deep breath and sat back down, ready to look one final time. He was going to take a full inventory of what was and wasn’t there, to see if there was any pattern. He didn’t have each page memorized, but he figured he might be able to fill in the gaps, if there were any.
    The timeline of his life was right there, on top of all of the other papers. Had he really missed it? Surely not. He was (mostly) used to these sorts of things now, but still couldn’t shake the chill in his spine. He decided to do an inventory of everything regardless.

    “I’m afraid I need your signature for this.” Turner looked up at the Mail person through the distortion of tears forming in his eyes. Now, he was embarrassed. It’s normal to cry, nothing to be ashamed about. He tells that to people often enough. He reaches down and signs to accept the delivery, hurriedly grabs the envelope, mutters “Thanks”, and rushes inside.
    The apartment is a touch messy, but otherwise fine. The biggest problem was the amount of takeout boxes spilling out of the trash can. Turner didn’t much feel like eating lately, and felt even less like cooking.
    He breaks the seal on the envelope to find a handwritten note laying on top of a set of papers. He expected the divorce papers underneath, just didn’t know when exactly they would come in. The note, however, was a bit unexpected. Despite the fact that everything had largely been amicable thus far, he thought she would want a clean break. He tossed the bundle of papers onto the counter and began reading the handwritten letter.
    “Turner,

    You know that I love you. I haven’t stopped loving you since I started, and I’m not sure I will ever stop. You knew these were coming, though. It hurt me to send these almost as much as I’m sure it hurt you to receive them. We have hashed things out so many times over but this is it. This is my final plea. My signature is on the papers.
    You can’t live your life helping others if you won't get help for yourself. If you send this back signed, I’ll know what decision you’ve made. However, if you decide to change, and do what needs to be done, you know where to find me.

    Love Always,
    Ellie”
    Of course it seemed easier on paper. Quit. Get Help. But it didn’t feel that easy in his mind. Ever since he was a teenager he has always dreamed of helping people like this. Work your whole life towards something only to have it eat away at you day after day until you feel like nothing but a husk of yourself, only the drive to help somehow still remaining. He certainly felt it, and tried to hide it as long as he could, but Ellie was far from stupid and saw right through him.
    He knew what he had to do. What he should do. What he could do. Were they all the same? Tears began to smudge the ink on the note and he realized he had been standing there for almost an hour. He grabbed a pen and looked at the papers. He felt like no matter what he did, his life was coming to an end.

    Turner decided to do nothing on day 63. Not that he did much on other days, but he reflected on his life. Funny, it had only been a little over 2 months in the hotel room, but he was already categorizing his life into “pre-hotel room” and “during hotel room”. The last 63 days had gone by in what felt like an eternity. They went by in what felt like a flash. Sometimes he couldn’t decide which. Laying in bed he took a deep breath and shut his eyes. He heard the front door unlatch and creak open. He froze in place, not knowing what to do. He felt like his body was locked in place, he was eager to escape, to get out. He finally opened his eyes to find the door shut.
    He definitely heard it. Or did he? He had thought he imagined things before. Could that have been the door opening, or just the sound of a door opening like the “cars passing by”? He slowly got up and checked the bathroom and the kitchen, making sure there wasn’t anything out of place. He decided to try the door to no avail.
    Distraught, he decides to walk back to bed and rest again, thinking it must have been his imagination. He stops for a moment at the whiteboard. He gets lost in thought looking over the options he has written down as to why he is there:
    1. KIDNAPPED BY A PSYCHO
    2. MENTAL BREAK
    3. GOVERNMENT EXPERIMENTATION
    4. PLACED IN SOME SORT OF SIMULATION
    5. ALIENS (ONLY KIND OF JOKING)
    6. LIMBO OR HELL
    7. SLAUGHTER
    Wait, what? “SLAUGHTER”? When did that change? The final item was “LAUGHTER”, which appeared on its own one day. When did it change? His head began to spin. Surely if the purpose was to kill him, it would have happened by now? Or was he meant to slaughter himself? The thought had occurred to him but he didn’t think he could act on it. He was determined to get out. Why would this appear all of the sudden? His head wasn’t just spinning, it was now a tornado of emotions. No, he had to collect himself. Write it down in the journal, then think about it.


    Turner used to have difficulty getting out of bed in the mornings, but after 70 days in the hotel room, getting up was one of the easier parts of his day. Maybe it was because he had nowhere to go or nothing to do. He got up and had a cup of coffee over breakfast.
    Once he finished breakfast, he reviewed his journal from yesterday. The only thing of note is that the voice on the other line of the “check-in” call sounded more familiar. Was he imagining things? Was it actually more familiar, or was his brain just desperately trying to make connections where there were none? He couldn’t decide and was getting a headache so he decided to stand in front of the whiteboard. He picked up a marker and all of a sudden felt dizzy.
    Suddenly images were swirling in his head. He was crying. He was relieved. He was angry. He was tired. He was writing “SLAUGHTER” but the words weren’t always there. They were always there. He continued writing past “SLAUGHTER” but nothing was on the board. He began laughing through tears as he circled “SLAUGHTER” on the board.

    He grabbed a pen and looked at the papers. He felt like no matter what he did, his life was coming to an end. Turner walked past the counter and grabbed a notepad from the kitchen. There were two phone numbers written on the notepad. He grabbed his phone out of his pocket, steadied his breathing, and called the first number. He gave them his insurance, wrote down the details of the appointment, and thanked them. That was hard, but far from the hardest call he would make today.
    He called the second number on the notepad. The department head confirmed that there was still an opening and that his experience would qualify him as an excellent candidate. He scheduled an interview, and ended the call on a good note.
    He stared long and hard at the contact he was about to call. “Office”. This would be the most difficult one. The people there would understand and even be very supportive, but it didn’t make it easier. Honestly, it would have made it easier if they were all horrible people. He makes the call, ready to bring an end to a chapter of his life.

    Turner awoke as a crumpled ball of sweat below the whiteboard. The last thing he remembered, he had written and circled “SLAUGHTER”. Or had he? It felt like him, but also like a distant memory of himself doing it. For that matter, what else had he written? He felt like “SLAUGHTER” was only part of it, as ominous as that felt. He wasn’t sure what he preferred, the word alone or knowing it was part of an unfinished point. Was he only feeling that way because he had thought it to be “LAUGHTER” for so long? He was spiraling again and felt weak, so he got up to get a glass of water. Once he finished his water, he ate some of his now cold lunch and still somewhat warm dinner on the desk.
    The phone rang. It was time for the “check-in”. He had ignored it a few times before, it would just ring for several minutes then stop. But when he answered it was always the same. He picked up the phone, waiting to hear the oft repeated line.

    “Hello Turner. How are you feeling today?” John answered. That question just undid all of the careful pushing away of emotions Turner had managed before making the call. Tears were streaming down his face, and he had yet to even say a word.
    “I…I’m not doing great, but I’m hanging in there.” There was no way John couldn’t tell he was in tears. “I really need to talk to you guys about something. I don’t think I…” Turner started to trail off, but regained focus. “I don’t think I can continue in this line of work. It’s just…I don’t think I’m able to put up a wall. I’m unable to keep the cuts of my work from bleeding into my home. I…” Turner trailed off again, but it just settled into quiet sobs.
    “Of course, Turner…listen, I know this was hard for you to make this call. We can talk on Monday, if you’re comfortable coming in. I’d prefer if you could tell your clients but I would be more than happy to handle that for you.” Again, this was so much harder simply because everyone there was so great. Turner took some deep breaths and responded. They figured out how they would handle things, or at least had a plan of what to do starting Monday.
    He felt a hundred pounds lighter when he finally hung up the phone. The cuff of his sleeve was damp with tears. He pulled up his phone and began dialing Ellie, only to stop himself short of hitting the call button. He couldn’t do this over the phone. He had to go to her. He grabbed his keys and sprinted out the door. He felt like he was reanimating, going from a husk back to his former self. Life was looking up, he would get back on the right track.

    Turner woke up on day 18. No, day 80. He shook his head and went to look at his journal pages in the drawers of the desk. He moved the plate holding an omelet to the side and pulled out the 17 pages of journal entries. No, it was 79. He was feeling disoriented. This wasn’t the first time, he had been here for almost 3 months and the days were bound to blur together. He took a bite of his bagel and read through the entry from the previous day.
    He always loved coffee but at the moment he really wanted some tea. Too bad there wasn’t any tea. There wasn’t a kettle, but if he had some tea bags he could probably boil water in the coffee pot. He hoped that tomorrow he would find a teapot next to his breakfast. That tickled his brain. A teapot. Why? He still hadn’t remembered everything that happened before he appeared in the room. When was the last time he had seen a teapot? Was that significant in some way?

    Turner threw his backpack filled with notepads and whatever books he was reading at the time into the back seat of the car as he carefully placed a bouquet of flowers in the seat. He was going to make things right. As he turned on his car, he realized the radio had an emergency weather alert playing.
    “...sudden thunderstorms have appeared. There are reports of flash flooding, hail, and severe rain. Conditions are ripe for a tornado. If you aren’t at home, it is advised to get there as soon as possible or shelter in place…” he was only a mile down the road from Ellie. It looked like the dark clouds were in the opposite direction he was going, and it had only just started to sprinkle a little bit. He could make it, he thought to himself. He turned at the light to begin going down the back roads to Ellie’s parents’ house.

    Turner was standing at the whiteboard. He had the marker in his hand. “TEAPOT?” was written to the side of the list. It kept jumping to the forefront of his brain. Why did that have any significance? Why would teapot matter? He couldn’t shake the thoughts from his head. He was going crazy. Had gone crazy.
    He walked to the bed and laid down. He shuts his eyes trying to collect his thoughts. What could teapot mean? All of a sudden, he hears a car outside the window, followed by tires screeching. Something different? Now? He rushes to the window and looks outside.

    The heavy rain came quicker than Turner thought it would. He thinks that he should have stayed at the store to wait this out, now that his car is in a ditch on the side of the road. He narrowly swerved to miss a branch that fell to the road in front of him, and luckily both he and his car were unharmed. He knows that staying in the car is a bad idea, but just through the rain he can see a building not too far from the highway. The storm is raging, but he doesn’t have much of a choice. He gathers his courage, opens the door and begins his sprint across the field to the hotel.

    Turner sees that it is raining outside the window. Every day has been the exact same thus far, no differences in weather outside the window. Until now. It’s raining and hailing quite hard. It’s raining as hard as…it begins falling into place.

    Running through a field of tall, wet grass interspersed by foot-deep puddles of rainwater and floating hail is quite a difficult task, even if Turner didn’t feel like the wind was trying to push against him with every step. Eventually he falls to his knees, he is nearly to the hotel. He gets up, soaking from head to toe and begins to take another step when the storm around him stops. He looks around, confused to see that he is in something like the eye of the storm. He looks around and notices there seems to be a circle that has to be several hundred feet wide that is completely unaffected by the storm around him. He looks up.

    It makes sense, it all makes sense. Turner rushes to the whiteboard, laughing, crying. He frantically grabs a marker. When he goes to write, he laughs, knowing he is right when he sees that “7. SLAUGHTER” is no longer written and circled on the board.

    It was unlike anything he had ever seen before. There was a large object hovering high off the ground at the direct center of the calm. Was this causing the storm, or stopping it? It looked like a dark steel pyramid with attached cylinders that looked like they could be turbines along the edges. There were dark mirror panels interspersed along the exterior. Suddenly, the beam of a floodlight hit the ground directly below the craft.
    Terror finally overtook Turner. He turned around, hoping to make his way back into the rain, the storm, as long as he could get away from this thing. The craft began slowly moving towards him, and with it, the light.

    Tears streaked down Turner’s face. Sweat clung to the sheets of the bed. The marker was in his hand. He had thrown the marker across the room. He pulled the marker up to the board. Everything made sense, and nothing made sense.
    Teapot. Not “LAUGHTER”, not “SLAUGHTER”, it was “SLAUGHTERHOUSE-FIVE”. The book, by Vonnegut. He realized what was going on. Like the main character in that book, he was learning how to experience memories across time. Turns out he was right with his half-joking guess about aliens. He went from being in a single moment to being in a sea of moments, experiencing them all at once. He heard the storm rage outside, where he was. Where he wasn’t. Where he would be, and had been. It all felt sudden, but truly it had been happening for a long time. He remembered things by experiencing them again.
    The weightlessness of being lifted through the air, not feeling anything while being brought onto the craft. The strange symbols on the walls and terminals surrounding him. What appeared to be a scan of his head hung up on the wall while indescribable beings examined him. The strange fluid they carried around him. The weightlessness of descending onto the roof of the hotel, to be brought inside and placed in bed.
    Turner wakes up in the dark, short of breath, sweat clinging to the sheets. He slows his breathing and calms himself down, thinking how ridiculous it is to still be dreaming about college over a decade after graduating. He wonders if it says something about himself, to still have these dreams feeling out of place.
    Suddenly images were swirling in his head. He was crying. He was relieved. He was angry. He was tired. He was writing “SLAUGHTERHOUSE-FIVE” but the words weren’t always there. They were always there. He began laughing through tears as he circled “SLAUGHTERHOUSE-FIVE” on the board.
    Laughing, and hearing the raging storm outside, he collapsed onto the bed, a mess of tears. He took a deep breath and closed his eyes. He heard the front door unlatch and creak open. He froze in place, not knowing what to do. He felt like his body was bound, he was eager to escape, to get out. He finally opened his eyes to find the door open, and a man in military clothing standing in the doorway, gun raised. He will issue a command to Turner to put his hands above his head and ask his name. Turner responded. Responds. Will respond.
    Turner is briefed and talked to by the government. It takes ages. It takes moments. No one was killed by the craft, there were some injuries as a result of the storm, but that’s it. Turner is relieved. Was he chosen for a reason? Did he just happen to be there? Who were the beings? He was asked all of these questions, and won't be able to answer them. He tells them about what he learned or will learn. He is finally released after what feels like days or mere moments, and can do what he set out to do so long ago.

    Turner is a little dehydrated, which causes his fingers to swell. He adjusts his ring after setting his stuff down. The military is still working on decoding the language but the limited amount of symbols he saw doesn’t help, even if he can still actively “see” them in a way. He uses the white board and markers to write out some notes for the exam before taking off his jacket. He suddenly feels anxious, glancing between his handwritten practice of the language, the board, and his students. He shuffles through his notes and is confused by the mix of english and nonsensical symbols until it clicks for him what exactly is going on.
