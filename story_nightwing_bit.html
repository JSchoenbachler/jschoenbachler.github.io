        <h1>Nightwing: Blüd is Thicker</h1>
        <div style="white-space: pre-wrap">
          A cold salty wind soars upwards once it crashes against the cliff of highrises near the beach. The wind makes its way past the nape of Dick Grayson’s neck, sending some shivers down his spine. He takes the first swig of his coffee against his better judgment, and burns the roof of his mouth a little. He feels just a bit warmer now. He won’t be able to think about anything other than the weird raw feeling in his mouth for a while now though.
          The top of a 15 story building in November isn’t the ideal place for a nighttime picnic, especially not in Bludhaven. The wind chill this time of year can get below freezing during the day and at night can drop to single digits. Dick thinks that if it isn’t already in the single digits, it will be soon. Even in his thermal suit, his neck and head still get cold. He wonders if he should add a hood to his outfit or something for the winter months. Anything but a cowl.
          The pizza is a bit cold now, but still not as cold as the icy air. He goes to wash down a bite with some coffee. Jesus, how is the coffee still so hot? He hardly swallows the drink without coughing.
          “You’re too easy to find, Nightwing.”
          The voice came from a few feet behind Dick, and although he didn’t actually hear Jason Todd approach, he was pretty good at pretending he did. “Bet it still took you longer than you’ll admit to find me. Want any pizza? It’s got vegan pepperoni. For not having had real pepperoni in awhile it sure tastes like the real stuff.”
          Jason stares for a moment before approaching the pizza box and grabbing a slice. Dick immediately regrets offering, but is also a bit worried now. He didn’t actually think he would eat some, it’s not usually his style. There's also only one cup of coffee, and doesn’t look like the new Robin costume has anywhere for drinks.
          “I know I said it last time, but gotta say it again: I like the new suit. A bit less vibrant than the…other…design. Do you happen to have a water pack and straw hidden somewhere in there? I only got coffee for one.” Dick hopes that Jason doesn’t pay too much attention to his stumble there. Due to previous disagreements, he tries to avoid discussing his tenure without Jason doing so first. Jason viewed almost everything as a competition, and also really didn’t like that he wasn’t the first Robin.
          “Yeah, it definitely doesn’t stand out as much as the neon spandex you wore,” Ouch. “And don’t be ridiculous.” Dick wasn’t sure exactly what he meant by that. Was it ridiculous to think that he has a water pack, or ridiculous to think he didn’t have a water pack? “I’m still surprised you chose blue for your suit colors. Red is proven to be one of the most psychologically intimidating colors out there. Blue is actually comforting for most people.”
          “Huh, wonder if that’s why the lights on police cars are blue and red. It’s half threat to the offending party, half comfort to the victim? Although maybe these police should just ride around with just red lights based on how they operate…”
          “I’m not stupid, you know.” Jason says suddenly without taking his eyes off his half eaten pizza.
          Dick internally sighs. Another perceived slight of some sort. Time to figure out what he did wrong this time, hopefully it wasn’t bringing up his (admittedly gaudy) old costume. “What do you mean?”
          “You’re wasting time chit chatting with me instead of directly asking why I’m here.”
          “Well, you’re participating by chit chatting back. What’s wrong with not being direct?”
          Jason is always analyzing and trying to figure out the motives of whoever he is talking to. Dick does this quite a bit as well, but takes a more subtle approach. Usually people respond better when you aren’t acting like a robot designed for psychoanalysis. “Being indirect wastes time. I also find that it’s easier to respect or fear someone when they speak directly to you.”
          “You say that as if fear and respect are the same. While they appear to be similar, I don’t think they are.” Dick knows that Jason is avoiding talking about whatever is bothering him. It’s not hard to understand why; Jason has major trust issues. He didn’t have anyone to trust but himself for a long time, and turning from barely surviving as a criminal into…whatever it is they do is not an easy transition. Dick sometimes wonders how similar they would be if he hadn’t been adopted so quickly by…
          “Batman says they are. I’m sure he taught you the same thing.”
          “Okay, can you give the hero names a rest? I swear if you call me anything other than my real name I’m taking my cold pizza elsewhere.” Okay, now it was time to be direct. “So, since you brought it up…why are you here?”
          Jason finishes his slice of pizza and looks out over the city. He’s trying to look away, not make this too personal. “At first I didn’t understand why you quit. It made me angry, actually. You had this life of luxury and excitement, and you gave up what you had. You left the only person who seemed to actually be doing something good for Gotham, and for what? So you could go swing around a new city and try to make a name for yourself? I would have killed to be in your position. If he hadn’t found me, I might have ended up being one of the ones delivered from the street to a prison infirmary by the infamous Batman, or worse.
          “Training was and still is brutal. Alfred treated me like a person and…Bruce…treated me like a dog he had to housebreak. Despite that, I still hated you and still couldn’t understand why you left. The job needed to be done, and it needed to be done by those who were most broken by the streets they were trying to break.” Jason was starting to crack a little bit. Dick had never seen him this vulnerable. It was obvious that Jason hated him from the first time they met, but to hear him say it felt different. I guess being direct did have its benefits.
          “After I had been doing this for a year, I had a revelation. I understood why you left. At that point I was still angry, but my hatred for you had combined with my existing hatred for someone else. Myself.” Jason’s demeanor had changed. He definitely seemed more vulnerable. That was sometimes a side effect of a direct approach.
          “About a month ago, it was cold like tonight, Bruce and I had traced some shipments of weapons to a warehouse owned by the Penguin. I’ll cut the exciting bits of breaking in undetected and whatnot. Long story short, we secured the weapons and kept a few goons conscious to interrogate. However, there were fewer weapons than what we expected. Without instruction or hesitation, I walked up to one of them and gave him a kick in the ribs at about half force. I felt a single rib crack as the blow landed and he began whimpering in pain. I asked him where the rest of the guns were and through sobs he told me he didn’t know. He gave me the whole schtick, ‘I’m just a low level guy, don’t know nothing, I only do this job to make ends meet for my wife and kid’ yadda yadda yadda.
          “Bruce was gathering evidence and called in the commissioner. Well this guy heard and started really sobbing. Like losing it. He was begging for us to let him go so he wouldn’t go to prison. Kept talking about how he was only doing this for Ben and he would never so much as shoplift a piece of gum after this. I gave him a pretty light gut punch to shut him up and began going through his pockets for any evidence he might have on him. When I checked his wallet I found a picture of him, his wife Maria, and his son, Ben.
          “I stared at the picture, mentally contrasting the bruised man on the floor in front of me with the innocent kid in the photo. They had the same hair, same eyes as well. Looked like their nose would have matched too if we hadn’t broken it. Chris was his name.
          “Bruce broke my stupor by asking me what I was doing. I turned around and asked him how long the commissioner would be. It was going to be 15 minutes. Quickly, I shoved the wallet back in Chris’ pants. ‘Just looking over some evidence and interrogating the goons. I counted 250 guns, how much does that leave us short?’ I said. Bruce told me ‘We expected 500. I counted 220. I'll double check.’
          “As he walked away I put my hand over Chris’ mouth and told him ‘Run home to your family. The police will be coming from all directions, but if you head east and stick to the beach until the second pier, they won't see you. Your mailbox will have 5 thousand dollars cash in it next Tuesday. I will not let you go if I see you again.’
          “I cut his bindings and let him sneak behind a crate to escape. At that point I threw a batarang in the opposite direction and shouted ‘Hey get back here!’ which got Bruce’s attention, and we ‘pursued’ the escaping goon in the wrong direction. When we came up empty handed, Bruce assumed he tried to swim to get away and wasn’t too concerned about him or his survival at that point.”
          By the time Jason finished, he was looking at Dick. Dick had to keep reminding himself to take bites so he didn’t sit there with his mouth agape, full of pizza during the story. He didn’t do anything as drastic as what Jason did for a long time. He now had a much better opinion of Jason than he had before.
          “I see,” Dick took a sip of his coffee to wash down the pizza. “Honestly, it took you much less time than I did to defy Bruce like that. Did he find out? I assume you’ve been tracking Chris, what happened to him?”
          “Bruce always finds out,” Always. “Luckily, he didn’t find out until after I had sent Chris the money. The punishment sucked but it could have been worse.
          “As far as Chris, Bruce never found out his personal details, so that is good at least. He and his family moved far away from Gotham, back to someplace his wife is from. The money was able to help them get set up far away from here.”
          Dick is relieved. “I’m happy to hear that. Not that it matters to you, but I am super proud of you for doing that. It takes a lot of courage to stand up to Bruce, even if he doesn’t know you’re doing it. It says a lot about you that you did that.”
          “You don’t think I…took the coward's way out by not confronting him head on?”
          “Not at all. You did the right thing. That’s what we’re supposed to do. That’s why I left.”
          “I know.”
          Another breeze kicks up. This time it doesn’t bring the chill to Dick. He is trying to navigate this conversation very carefully. He doesn’t want to encourage Jason to leave Bruce, but he also wants Jason to know he might not be able to change Bruce in a direct manner. It’s like walking a conversational tightrope.
          “Listen…Bruce is harsh sometimes. Okay, a lot of the time. But despite what he wants everyone else to believe, he is still Bruce underneath Batman. He once told me ‘Bruce died the same day his parents did.’ For a long time I believed him. When I left, I still believed him. Honestly, I believed it all the way up until he took you in. I mean trying to steal the wheels off the batmobile…that’s pretty ballsy. I think it almost earned you some respect in his eyes. Anyways, getting caught by Batman while you’re trying to steal from him? When I was Robin, he wouldn’t have thought twice about sending you off to juvie or jail for that. What did he do, though? He took you in. He trained you. He taught you respect and fear, but I think even now those lessons are beginning to separate. Honestly, I don’t believe for a second that Bruce didn’t find out until after you gave Chris the money. Hell, he probably knew the second you released him. But he let it happen. I think he sees a lot of himself in you, and wants the both of you to find a healthier way to cope with what we do.”
          There isn’t exactly a support group or therapist for “ex-superhero sidekick orphans with paternal issues” but Dick thought he and Jason understood each other pretty well. He wanted to be there for Jason from the beginning, despite the anger and jealousy. It felt like they finally got there tonight. They weren’t just people who had the same job with the same boss anymore, now they were adopted brothers. With one hell of an adopted father.
          “Hmm. I think you’re probably right.” Jason stands up, pulls a tube out of his collar, and begins drinking from it like a straw.
          “I knew it! You DO have a water pack under there!” Dick is pretty jealous. How did they get that to fit in there? He’s going to try to figure it out as soon as he gets home.
          “I told you to not be ridiculous. It’s pretty cold out and I can’t stay out too long without Bruce taking notice. I’m heading back to the manor now. Next time we chat I’ll bring the schematics for the suit, so you can see how it works.” Jason walks to the ledge with his grappling hook out, and takes a pause, looking back at Dick. “By the way…thanks. I don’t hate you anymore, for what it’s worth. I respect you for leaving, but I’m definitely not afraid of you. Maybe they are different.”
          Just like that, Dick is left alone again on the roof. The pizza is actually cold now, and the coffee is getting there. He tidies up, and begins the careful descent of the building while holding the pizza and coffee, which isn’t easy. He returns to his apartment and sneaks in through the fire escape. As he is getting into the shower he finds a note on his sink: “I’ve seen some of the stuff you’re doing. It’s impressive but reckless. If you need tools or gear, don’t feel too proud to reach out. -Bruce”
